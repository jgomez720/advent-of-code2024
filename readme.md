# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This repository contains my personal solutions to the daily coding challenges.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory under the `solutions` folder. The structure is as follows:

```
solutions/
├── day01/
│   ├── part1.py
│   └── part2.py
├── day02/
│   ├── part1.py
│   └── part2.py
...
```

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, Part 1:

```sh
cd solutions/day01
python part1.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Any additional dependencies will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file within each day's directory.

## Contributing
